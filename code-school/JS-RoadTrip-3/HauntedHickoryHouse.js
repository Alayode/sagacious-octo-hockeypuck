// Code School: Changing Declarations to Expressions

// Developers for the Forest of Function Expressions
// Theme Park have created a function declaration named forestFright,
// but theyâ€™ve decided not to keep the function in memory.
// Convert the function from a named function
// declaration to an anonymous function
// expression and assign it to a variable called runAway.
